How to use:
(URP ONLY)

1. Create an empty gameobject. 
2. Add TerrainGenerator.cs to that empty gameobject.
3. MAKE SURE you have atleast one texture in the layer array. (It has to be 512x512, Read/write ON and repeating)
4. Create a new material using TerrainShader. (Just search TerrainShader in the material search and it should come up)
5. Attach said material to the script. 
6. Mess around with the values and have fun :)

HOTKEYS:
You can use (T) to force a new generation while in playmode. 
You can use Y to keep generating while in play mode.
You can use U to make the terrain fly forward.

All of these shortcuts can be changed or edited out in TerrainGenerator.cs of cours :)
